* **What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

  I felt relatively confident with most of it, but after 3 days of not using it, some of it was a bit rusty.  The GPS was a great opportunity to review the things I'd forgotten the specifics of over a few days of inactivity.

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

  Creating, Navigating Between, and Merging branches were good to review. I had to ask a handful of questions about them to regain my footing, and having Katy as our guide was helpful therein.

* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

  **Michael** works in a windows environment, so I was fascinated to learn the slight differences between his bash commands and mine. **Our Guide Katy** was helpful for clarification on things like the shortcut for launching a file with sublime and the previously mentioned git branch review.

* **What still confuses you about Git?**

  While I know I have plenty more to learn and am eager to do so, I wouldn't say I am *confused* about anything in particular, and feel confident about using git going forward. **GitHub** on the other hand still leaves me feeling a *little bit* lost, particularly when merging branches and evaluating comments, commits, and being sure to compare the correct branches when having forked a repo.

* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

  I quite enjoyed my first experience pairing in a GPS, having a guide handy was valuable, and haiving my first experience under my belt I can see why practicing pairing can will be valuable - I felt unsure at times, for example, how often I should make room for my pair to lead the discussion, and how to do so while also making sure I participated just as much.
