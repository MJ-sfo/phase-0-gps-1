Release 7: Reflect
Each of you should add a reflection file to the same repo. Be sure to start on a feature branch! Create a new file named Lastname-reflection.md. Answer the following questions in that file using Markdown. Go through the Git workflow to add, commit, make a pull request, and merge it to the master branch.

Answer these questions in your reflection:

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Clone pull push was rough.  

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
besides clarifying how to show screens on hangouts, and how to work as a team through the Internet - Merge Conflict was important to clarify.  How to create a conflict, and how to solve.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
My pair, i ask to reminded of commands for Terminal.  For my guide, i asked how to work trough hangouts - how to show screen, share link to partner.  

What still confuses you about Git? My "grep" didn't work last week.  I reloaded Git today, but haven't practiced grep.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? the Experience was good.  Our guide was great, patient, and smoothly helped us through new parts, like pull and push.
